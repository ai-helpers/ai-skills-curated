# Knowledge sharing - Curated AI Skills

## Table of Content (ToC)

## Overview

[This project](https://github.com/ai-engineering-helpers/ai-skills-curated)
aims at collecting so-called AI agent/assistant skills (and associated rules).
Each skill set may be installed either locally in a given project or in the user
space, for instance in the `~/.agents/skills/`, where typical assistants/agents
(_e.g._, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) will find them and will be able to use them.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
